## Homework Assignment
This is the homework assignment for "Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary". We are instructed to:

*"...build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user."*
## Description
This is a node application to create a html page from the users inputs. Each question will ask the user 5 questions, beginning with the manager's information (their name, ID number, Email, and office number). The fifth question will ask the user whether they want to add and *"Intern"*, *"Employee"*, or *"No more Employees"*
